### About Me

By nature I'm an insanely curious person with a great enthusiasm for tech who constantly needs to be learning something new. I thrive in intellectually stimulating work environments, and am currently in the process of cultivating a passion for good code.

After my degree, I made a conscious decision to try and travel the world whilst financially supporting myself from my laptop. I found several freelance writing jobs and spent 2 years living and working in Morocco, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Guatemala, and China. I am currently learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly-selective software development bootcamp in London.

I'm looking for a career in London's tech scene as a full-stack developer, in which I can continue to push myself and learn something new every day.

**Coding Languages:** JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, HTML5, CSS  
**Tech Skills:** TDD, Pair Programming, Google Ninja

**Logical/Analytical Thinker**

Logical thinking has always been my strong point - throughout school, I consistently achieved the highest grades in Maths. Additionally, I am a keen chess player.

Later, I learned to critique experimental designs and evaluate academic literature as a fundamental part of my degree in Experimental Psychology. In learning to code, the opportunity to flex my logical thinking muscles once again has been hugely enjoyable and rewarding.

**Excellent Communicator**

For two years I was a freelance writer, having my work published online at Canvas and Music is My Sanctuary, as well as published in print for Middlesex University. I learned to adapt my writing for different audiences, crafting my style for their specific requirements, and was obsessive about improving my skills.

Whilst traveling, I believe my verbal communication has also significantly improved. In two years I've lived in 5 countries for more than 3 months. As a result, I am comfortable communicating with people from a diverse range of backgrounds.

Since choosing to become a developer, I have continued to improve my written communication skills by blogging about my experience learning to code.

**Creativity**

I've always got an idea on the go. I love brainstorming and bouncing my thoughts off other people.

In the final year of my degree, I was chosen for a highly competitive dissertation project specifically for my ability to generate ideas. I put this into use by coming up with a piece of original research and rigorously designing an experiment.

Additionally, I've written a bunch of songs, composed music for an animation, designed a learning application (and am tinkering with ideas for several others), and am currently working on 3 novels (which may or may not ever get completed).
