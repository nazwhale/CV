### About Me

Six months ago I thought I was a person without a passion.

I’m now a developer who spends his spare time going to meet-ups and conferences, reading tech articles, and getting excited about learning to make bots and neural networks. Coding has taken over my life. I still can't quite believe it.

Currently I'm looking for a career in London's tech scene as a full-stack developer, in a company working at the cutting-edge. Working on a product that I can get excited about is crucial, as is working for a company that will support me in learning new skills.

When I'm pushed to learn something new every day, for a cause I believe in, I'm extremely motivated and productive.

**Tech Skills:** TDD, Pair Programming, Agile, Language-Agnostic, Vim Ninja

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

Currently, I'm honing my skills at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a highly-selective software development bootcamp in London. I love working in an intellectually stimulating environment, have become adept at independent problem-solving, and am improving my teamwork-related soft-skills every day.

**Logical/Analytical Thinker**

Logical thinking has always been my strong point - throughout school, I consistently achieved the highest grades in Maths. Additionally, I am a keen chess player.

Later, I learned to critique experimental designs and evaluate academic literature as a fundamental part of my degree in Experimental Psychology. In learning to code, the opportunity to flex my logical thinking muscles once again has been hugely enjoyable and rewarding.

**Excellent Communicator**

Since choosing to become a developer, I have strived to improve my written communication skills by blogging about my experience learning to code. I believe that the ability for a developer to communcicate their code to others is crucial. As a result, I'm constantly trying to improve my powers of articultion using the correct vocabularly.

For two years I was a freelance writer, having my work published online at Canvas and Music is My Sanctuary, as well as published in print for Middlesex University. I learned to adapt my writing for different audiences, crafting my style for their specific requirements, and was obsessive about improving my skills.

Whilst traveling, I believe my verbal communication also significantly improved. In two years I've lived in 5 countries for more than 3 months. From this expirience I became comfortable communicating with people from a diverse range of backgrounds.

**Creativity**

I've always got an idea on the go. I love brainstorming and bouncing my thoughts off other people.

In the final year of my degree, I was chosen for a highly competitive dissertation project specifically for my ability to generate ideas. I put this into use by coming up with a piece of original research and rigorously designing an experiment.

Additionally, I've written a bunch of songs, composed music for an animation, designed a learning application (and am tinkering with ideas for several others), and am currently working on 3 novels (which may or may not ever get completed).

### Work Experience

**Freelance Writer** (May '16 to February '17)
Writing reports, online journalism and copywriting for various companies to fund a globetrotting lifestyle for 2 years after university. Clients included Middlesex University, Canvas, and Music is my Sanctuary.

**Investigative Journalist - Ecostorm** (August '15 to May '16)
Researching companies violating human and animal rights and compiling reports. I also conducted undercover fieldwork using hidden cameras.

**Research Assistant - University College London** (July to September '14)
Assisted with the running of experiments at the Psychopharmacology lab.

### Life Experience

After my degree, I made a conscious decision to try and travel the world whilst financially supporting myself from my laptop. I found several freelance writing jobs and spent 2 years living and working in Morocco, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Guatemala, and China.

While traveling, I always kept learning.
Here are some things I can now do, which I couldn't when I graduated:

- Discipline myself as a freelancer
- Copywrite professionally with impeccable grammar
- Speak Spanish at a strong intermediate level
- Fly a paraglider (achieved private license)
- Touch my toes (3 months kung-fu study in China)
