### About Me

Six months ago I thought I was a person without a passion.

Previously a writer and journalist, last summer I had an idea for a learning application. After obsessively designing the user-experience, I wanted the power to make my idea a reality. I became curious about coding and realised there was a world of things I'd be able to make if I had the skills.

I’m now a developer who spends his spare time going to meet-ups and conferences, [writing a coding blog](http://www.medium.com/@nazwhale), reading tech articles, and using words like 'dope!' and 'stoked!' about VR, bots, and neural networks. Coding has taken over my life. I still can't quite believe it.

Currently I'm looking for a career in London as a full-stack developer, in an ambitious company working at the top of their field. Working on a product that I can get excited about is crucial, as is working in a team that will support me in learning new skills.

When I'm in an intellectually stimulating environment, working for a cause I believe in, I'm extremely motivated and productive.

**Tech Skills:** TDD, Pair-Programming, Agile, XP Values, Vim Ninja

|  [Spaceship](https://github.com/nazwhale/spaceship)   |  I'm very proud of this project. Integrating virtual reality with Amazon's Alexa seemed like a mad mission for group of 10-week-old devs, but we made it work, learnt a ton (specifically regarding groupwork, cloud services, and programming for VR), and even implemented a couple of extra features. See the repo for our daily "Log Book".    | JavaScript, Node.js, Jasmine, A-Frame, Firebase, Alexa & AWS Lambda        | Coming soon... |
|  [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/nazwhale/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)   |  A task to refactor a poor piece of programming. Despite being a small project, I'm proud of the cleanliness and testability of my code. It was really satisfying to realise how far I've come in terms of object-oriented programming and test-driven development. | Ruby, RSpec          | N/A |
|  [Number Identifier](https://github.com/nazwhale/playing-with-tensorflow)   |  A convolutional Neural Network that learnt how to identify hand-written digits with 98% accuracy. This was meant to be part of a larger group project that never got finished, so I've linked the repo in which the Tensorflow experiments took place.          | Python, Tensorflow          | [Neural Network in a Week](https://medium.com/@nazwhale/neural-network-in-a-week-3ef84175191b) |
|   [PoochPads](https://github.com/kittysquee/poochpads)     |  An AirBnB-style bookings app for dog-owners, and my first collaborative project. We learnt a lot about collaberating with Git, and well as delegating features between us, having regular stand-ups, and working with XP values and Agile practices. |   Ruby, PostgreSQL, BCrypt, HTML, CSS, RSpec, Capybara         | [Team Time](https://medium.com/codewhale/team-time-6fa9a64d8282) |

Somehow I've ended up with a ridiculous amount of weird coding experiments from my weekends at Makers. Here are a few of the most coherent:
- NazBot
  - A Twitter Bot using the Guardian's API to reply to tweets with relevant news stories ([Give it a go!](https://twitter.com/thenazbot/with_replies))
  - [Repo](https://twitter.com/thenazbot/with_replies)
  - [Blog Post](https://medium.com/codewhale/on-rails-9346ab7a56b9)
- Star Wars Facts
  - A skill for Amazon's Alexa, now [published on the US skills store](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0725WTNWZ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1495642862&sr=1-1&keywords=star+wars+facts)
  - I adapted a tutorial directly into AWS Lambda one Sunday afternoon, so unfortunately there's no repository on GitHub (yet)
- Dusty
  - A featherweight testing framework for JavaScript. It only has 3 matchers, and, thought I realise this might be excessively featherweight, it was fun to make and pleasing to publish
  - [Repo](https://github.com/nazwhale/dusty)
  - [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@nazwhale/diving-deeper-a6e519c21ab)
  - It's [published to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dusty-testing). People are downloading it!

**Creativity**

In the last month at Makers Academy, from a group of 24, I came up with a quarter of the democratically chosen ideas for the practice and final projects.

Furthermore, I was chosen for a highly competitive dissertation project at UCL specifically for my ability to generate ideas. I put this into use by coming up with a piece of original research and rigorously designing an experiment.

In my own time I've written a bunch of songs, composed music for an animation, and am currently working on a novel.

**Communication**

I believe that the ability for a developer to communicate their code to others is crucial. As a result, I've paid close attention the way in which I articulate my code when pair-programming and working in groups, a feature of my life as a developer. I've put this into practice by teaching HTML and CSS to beginners at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/). Additionally, I've strived to improve my written communication skills by [blogging](http://www.medium.com/@nazwhale) about my experience learning to code weekly.

For two years I was a freelance writer, having my work published online at Canvas and Music is My Sanctuary, as well as published in print for Middlesex University. I learned to adapt my writing for different audiences, crafting my style for their specific requirements. I was obsessive about improving my skills. I hope my writing skills will be useful in crafting high quality documentation as a developer.

Since leaving university I've lived in 5 countries, each for more than 3 months. From this experience I became comfortable communicating with people from a diverse range of backgrounds.

**Logical/Analytical Thinker**

Logical thinking has always been my strong point - throughout school, I consistently achieved my highest grades in Maths and Sciences. Additionally, I am a keen chess player.

Later, I learned to critique experimental designs and evaluate academic literature as a fundamental part of my degree in Experimental Psychology. In learning to code, the opportunity to flex my logical thinking muscles once again has been hugely enjoyable and rewarding.

#### Work Experience

**Freelance Writer - Various** (May '16 to February '17)
Writing reports, online music journalism, and copywriting for various companies to fund a globetrotting lifestyle for 2 years after university.

**Investigative Journalist - Ecostorm** (August '15 to May '16)
Researching companies violating human and animal rights and compiling reports. I also conducted undercover fieldwork using hidden cameras.

**Research Assistant - University College London** (July to September '14)
Assisted with the running of experiments at the Psychopharmacology lab.

#### Life Experience

After my degree, I made the decision to travel the world whilst financially supporting myself from my laptop. I found several freelance writing jobs and spent 2 years living and working in Morocco, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Guatemala, and China.

While traveling, I always tried to keep learning.
Here are some things I can do, which I couldn't when I graduated:

- Discipline myself as a freelancer
- Copywrite professionally with impeccable grammar
- Speak Spanish at a strong intermediate level
- Fly a paraglider (achieved private license)
- Touch my toes (3 months kung-fu study in China)
